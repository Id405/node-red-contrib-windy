# node-red-contrib-windy
Node red node to upload weather data to windy.com

**this node is currently in development. It works but do not expect thorough testing or stability**

This node is designed to take raw weather station data and upload that to windy. It was made for use with the [rtl_443 node](https://github.com/dayne/node-red-contrib-rtl_433) but should work with other weather stations as well.
